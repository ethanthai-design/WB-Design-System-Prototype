# Preview App - WB Design System

The **Preview App** is a showcase and testing environment for the components built in `Library-Core`.

## 🚀 Running the App

To start the preview application:
```bash
ng serve Preview-App
```
Or from the root `Development-Source` directory:
```bash
npm start
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

## 🏗 Purpose

Use this application to:
- Test components in a real-world application context.
- Demonstrate new features and UI patterns to stakeholders.
- Verify theme switching and responsiveness.

## 🛠 Adding to the Showcase

1.  **Import**: Import the necessary modules or components from `Library-Core` into `src/app/app.component.ts`.
2.  **Display**: Add the component to the `app.component.html` template.
3.  **Style**: Add any showcase-specific styles in `src/app/app.component.scss` or `src/styles.scss`.
